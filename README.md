# 🗑️ Smart Waste Management & Monitoring System
*“A smart, AI-powered, IoT-enabled platform for cleaner and healthier cities.”*

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Har saal shahron aur gaon me **kachre ke dher** (small piles aur large dumps) ki wajah se:
- Ganda mahaul banta hai  
- Badbu aur diseases failti hain  
- Waste segregation nahi hone ki wajah se recycling mushkil hoti hai  
- Municipal workers ko monitoring aur clearance me dikkat hoti hai  

---

## 🎯 Our Objective
- Real-time **waste pile detection & monitoring**  
- Small aur Large piles ke liye **different tech solutions**  
- AI-based data analysis for future planning  
- Dashboard for municipal authorities  
- Easy mobile app for citizens

## 🏗️ Problem → Solution Mapping

| 🗑️ Waste Problem | ⚡ Challenges | 💡 Tech Solution |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Chhote kachre ke dher (Street-side piles)** | Bins jaldi bhar jate hain, ganda mahaul, collection delay | IoT-based smart bins with fill-level sensors, auto alerts, optimized truck routes |
| **Bare kachre ke dher (Large dumps in open areas)** | Monitoring mushkil, health hazards, illegal dumping | Drone/CCTV image detection with AI, Dashboard heatmaps, AI-based segregation |
| **Wet & Dry Waste Mixing** | Recycling impossible, bad smell | AI Vision Model for automatic waste classification, dual-compartment smart bins |
| **Citizen Engagement Problem** | Awareness aur reporting nahi hoti | Mobile App (photo + location reporting), gamified reward system |
| **Unplanned Collection Routes** | Fuel waste, time delay | AI-based route optimization + GPS tracking for vehicles |
| **Data Transparency Issues** | Authorities ko real-time info nahi milta | Centralized Web Dashboard + Monthly Analytics Reports |
